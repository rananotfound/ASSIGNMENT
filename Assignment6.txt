Q1. Create an Interface called Animals with speak(), eat() methods. 
    Create two classes Cat and Dog implementing their own versions of these methods.

Program:-




package animals;

public interface Animals {
    
    
    public void speak();
    public void eat();
    
}






package animals;

public class Cat implements Animals  {

    public void speak() {
        System.out.println("I am a Cat !");
    }

    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("I eat Fish");
    }
    public static void main(String args[]){
              Cat cat = new Cat();
      cat.speak();
      cat.eat();  
    }
    
}






package animals;

public class Dog implements Animals  {

    public void speak() {
        System.out.println("I am a Dog !");
    }

    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("I eat Meat");
    }
    public static void main(String args[]){
            Dog dog = new Dog();
          dog.speak();
          dog.eat();
    }
}

Q2. Create an Abstract Class Animals with color, breed and name as variables, along with eat() abstract method and also a speak() method which is not abstract.


Program:-




Q3. Take two numbers as string input and convert them into Integers and find the maximum of the two numbers.

Program:-

package stringconvert;

public class StringConvert {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        
        int a=Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        int b=Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
        if(a<b)
        {
            System.out.println("B is Greater and The Number is :"+b);
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.println("A is Greate and The Number is :"+a);
        }
        
        
    }
    
}
